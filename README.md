# Geophysics ML Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Geophysics_ML.ipynb`) dedicated to applying Machine Learning techniques to geophysical data. The project explores preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps to extract meaningful insights from the data.

## Project Objectives

1. Analyze and preprocess geophysical data for machine learning applications.
2. Build and evaluate predictive models for geophysical properties.
3. Visualize results and interpret their implications in the geophysical context.

## Notebook Structure

The notebook is structured as follows:

1. **Introduction**:
   - Overview of the dataset and project goals.
2. **Field data processing**:
   - Handling missing values.
   - Normalization and feature engineering.
3. **Geological core data processing**:
   - Importing and cleaning geological core data.
   - Integration with field data for a unified dataset.
   - Handling categorical variables and encoding.
4. **Contour plots and preliminary results**:
   - Metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and accuracy.
   - Visual interpretations of the results.
5. **Machine Learning**:
   - Implementation of Machine Learning algorithms (e.g., Regression, Neural Networks).
   - Hyperparameter tuning and optimization.
   - Summary of key findings and suggestions for future research.

## Key Features

- **Data Analysis**:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Application of regression and classification techniques for predictive analysis.
- **Visualization**:
  - Utilization of Matplotlib and Seaborn for in-depth data visualizations.
